# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-11)

**Core value:** A human can coordinate multiple terminal agents through a reliable, observable workflow where the coordinator keeps work moving without hiding what happened.
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.1 Adaptive Coordination planning complete; Phase 06 is next

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Build coordinator automation as a workflow layer on top of the existing mailbox/task model
- Initialization: Exclude full autonomous swarm behavior from the first milestone
- [Phase 01]: Run membership is derived from tasks/*.yaml under each run directory instead of a child_task_ids index on the run record.
- [Phase 01]: Coordinator state uses dedicated run/task records instead of Envelope.Meta so dependency and ownership fields stay explicit.
- [Phase 01]: Child task messages reuse the run root thread and reply-to linkage for transcript-free reconstruction.
- [Phase 01]: Run rebuild validates child task message threads against the run root thread so artifact drift fails loudly.
- [Phase 01]: Operator inspection renders task IDs, owners, expected output, state, and message IDs as the durable run debugging surface.
- [Phase 02]: Agent role metadata now uses RoleSpec with canonical task-class kinds and normalized domains.
- [Phase 02]: RouteChildTask ranks kind-matching candidates by route_priority descending, then config declaration order ascending.
- [Phase 02]: Coordinator decomposition now routes through tmuxicate run route-task before using run add-task as the explicit-owner persistence path.
- [Phase 02]: Duplicate routing now blocks by default unless the task class is explicitly listed in routing.fanout_task_classes.
- [Phase 02]: Routed child tasks persist normalized domains, duplicate keys, and routing decisions directly on canonical task YAML so run show explains routes from disk alone.
- [Phase 03]: Review linkage is canonicalized in `coordinator/runs/<run-id>/reviews/<source-task-id>.yaml` instead of reverse pointers on task records.
- [Phase 03]: Review tasks use dedicated `review_request` and `review_response` message kinds, and `run show` rebuilds the review chain from durable artifacts.
- [Phase 04]: Blocker handling uses durable `BlockerCase` artifacts with explicit reroute, escalation, and operator resolution paths.
- [Phase 05]: Run summaries are a derived `RunGraph` view rendered at the top of `run show`, not a new persisted artifact or command family.
- [Phase 05]: Completing the coordinator root task prints the same shared summary once using canonical root-message metadata.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Existing daemon lifecycle and session-package test gaps are relevant because coordinator automation increases workflow coupling
